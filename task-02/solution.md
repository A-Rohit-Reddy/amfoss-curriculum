	Shopping is something which is a part of our everyday life , and it involves a lot of tasks going on at the backend as well. I bet many different data types could be used while building a shopping cart. According to me, number and string data types would be ones I would require the most, for items and their prices, which is the formost detail to 
	be specified in a cart.I could also use the boolean datatype maybe to check whether if an item is available or not, as well as NUll for the absence of any value. I would use non-primitive data types, i.e, objects , functions and arrays. Objects could be used to hold the items with their prices and I could further use
	 the arrays to specify a list of items belonging to a particular brand or even specify different brands of items of the same type. While there are different ideas, I would finish 
	off by using functions to define specific tasks, like calculating total price, number of quantites, or reading the price, or checking the expiry, etc.. I could use these functions
	 later whenever necessary to perform the subsequent tasks.
